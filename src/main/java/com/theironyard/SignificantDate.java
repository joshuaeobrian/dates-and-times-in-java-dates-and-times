 * This class provides a set of static properties and methods used to calculate

 *
 * As a part of this exercise you will have to make use of a number of classes
 * and enumerations in the java.time package.
 *
 * Follow the instructions below to create the class.

public class SignificantDate {

    /**
     * Start this class by creating a set of read only static properties that
     * are publicly accessible. Remember, the final keyword is used to make a
     * property read only. Each of the properties will represent a month and
     * day without a year. Java provides a class named java.time.MonthDay which
     * meets this requirement.
     *
     * http://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/time/MonthDay.html
     *
     * Create properties for at least the following dates:
     *
     * - New Years Day: January 1st
     * - Valentines Day: February 14th
     * - Leap Year: February 29th
     * - Fourth Of July: July 4th
     * - Christmas: December 25th
     * - New Years Eve: December 31st
     *
     * Be sure to give each of these properties a reasonable name that follows
     * convention. For example, GROUNDHOG_DAY.
     *
     * The MonthDay class is consistent with the rest of the java.time package
     * in that you can't simply create am instance using the new keyword.
     * Instead, you will need to use it's of() method:
     *
     * http://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/time/MonthDay.html#of-java.time.Month-int-
     *
     * When setting the month for the new MonthDay, you are not allowed to use
     * the number of the month. EG, `MonthDay.of(12, 9)` is forbidden because
     * you explicitly used the number 12 for December. Instead, use the
     * java.time.Month enumeration. Enumerations are similar to classes, except
     * that they restrict values to a specific range. This enum has static
     * properties representing each month:
     *
     * http://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/time/Month.html#enum.constant.summary
     *
     * Here's a allowable example for Groundhog Day:
     *
     * MonthDay.of(Month.FEBRUARY, 2);

            using a while loop. You should loop until you find a valid year for
            the date that is after today.

            The MonthDay class has a method isValidYear() that returns true if
            a date occurs in that year. This method is useful because it will
            return false if we're looking for February 29th in a year that
            doesn't have a leap year. For example, February 29th, 2017 would
            return false.

            The MonthDay class has another method, atYear() that returns a
            LocalDate object for the month and day in the specified year. This
            is useful for getting a reference to a date in a particular year.

            http://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/time/MonthDay.html#atYear-int-

            The LocalDate class has a method named isAfter() that will return
            true if the date is after the the specified date. We can use this to
            see if a date at a specific year is after today's date.

            http://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/time/LocalDate.html#isAfter-java.time.chrono.ChronoLocalDate-

            Knowing all of the above, we can loop from this year into the future
            until we find the next valid instance of a date that is in the
            future.

            Keep in mind that if we're at January 3 2017, the next instance of
            Valentines Day is still this year and the next occurrence of New
            Years Day is in 2018.
